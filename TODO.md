- FriendGPT: This friendly version of ChatGPT remembers who you are (ConversationSummaryBufferMemory which is stored in txt file).
- PyGPT: This one has access to a Python interpreter.
- ToolGPT: Searches your documents, browses the web, and does other stuff for you.
           Careful that it doesn't leak sensitive information though! Only whitelisted files are seen.
            May also do math and Python. Not sure if Python is possible with the others though.
